        <p class="intro"> "There is an intense energy in the universe these days, based on the experiences we are going through. You can see in the pictures that the hair gravitates into different directions. Because of the stillness we are experiencing, we go back to our roots, reflecting different eras--like the Renaissance-- and appreciating the beauty of simplicity.
        It’s also a great time for honoring our most authentic self, our perfect imperfections. We’re diving into our souls, finding stillness, peace, and gratitude, while our external environment is going through a major transformation...acknowledging that nothing will remain the same." <br> -Mustafa Yanaz</p>

        <p><strong>Where are you quarantined? How did you end up there?</strong> <br>
        I am quarantined in my apartment in New York City.
        The day the travel ban was announced, I was shooting in Europe.
        The next day, I flew back to New York. I got on the last flight that was allowed to fly into New York.
        <br><br><strong>Who are you quarantined with? How is it going?</strong><br>
        I am quarantined with my wife.
        It is an interesting time; we recently haven’t spent this much time together because we both travel often for work.
        In general, I think that time apart keeps relationships fresh since you always miss each other. Luckily, we’ve been having a really good time together during this and we enjoy the solitude.
        <br><br>
       <strong>What is your current state of mind?</strong><br>
        I’m excited and relieved since I’ve heard that non-essential workers will be allowed to go back to work soon.<br>

        <p><strong>What was your biggest worry one month ago? What is it now?</strong><br>
        My biggest worry was that someone in my family would get infected, which thankfully has not happened so far.
        I can finally see the light at the end of the tunnel. We might be able to work again soon, although I know it will not be the same as it was before.
        My biggest worry now is that I will not be able to see my family in Europe for a while.<br><br>

        <strong>What was your most treasured possession one month ago? What is it now? </strong> <br>
        My Turkish guitar (Saz).
        Recently, I bought an old CamCorder. It’s always with me now. <br><br>

        <strong>If you could have dinner with one person this evening, who would it be? What would you eat?</strong> <br>
        Andrew Cuomo. I would love to eat his homemade spaghetti.
