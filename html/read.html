<P>
    In times of turmoil <br>
    it is hard to imagine<br>
    being creative. <br> <br> 
    But as the world seems intent <br>
    on stripping away<br>
    everything that is known,  <br>
creating feels radical, healing and essential. <br> <br>
We cannot govern the <br>
chaos of our surroundings <br>
but we can reflect <br>
the realities of our experiences <br>
and the inner-workings <br>
of our deepest selves. <br> <br>
Right now, <br>
we are presented with <br>
a rare opportunity; <br>
Why not create for <br>
creation's sake? <br> <br>
Let's make art-<br>
wherever you are, <br>
with whatever you have. <br> <br>

Get READY.
