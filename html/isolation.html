        <p><strong>Where are you quarantined? How did you end up there?</strong><br><br>
        Martin Cole: In my apartment on the West side of Berlin, Germany. It’s been home for the past ten years. <br> <br>
        Boe Marion: In my dreams, I am quarantined with all my friends out in nature, baking bread on hot stones and drinking beer. But I constantly wake up from that dream and then find myself in Stuyvesant Heights, which is indeed lovely also but in a different way. <br><br>
        <strong>Who are you quarantined with? How is it going? </strong> <br> <br>
        MC: I’m Quarantined with my girlfriend and our dog. Home life has not changed for us; we work from our home studio. But, going for a walk or to the supermarket has become a military operation.<br> <br>
        BM: My wife, Olivia, and our grey male cat, Miso, and our plants. It’s been great. <br> <br>
        <strong>What is your current state of mind? </strong> <br> <br>
        MC: I know it could be like this for 18 months and I can see past that. <br> <br>
        BM:“Nocturama” </p>

        <p> <strong>What was your biggest worry one month ago? What is it now?</strong><br><br>
        MC: If I’m honest, the supermarket always felt like a mission. But I think like most, the health of our loved ones. <br> <br>
        BM: I don’t really worry much. But a month or so ago, having enough time to be in nature was something I longed for. And now that I have all the time in the world, different institutions around the US are closing down nature... I have mixed feelings about that. Where I come from, Nature doesn’t have a closing time.<br><br>
        <strong>What was your most treasured possession one month ago? What is it now? </strong> <br><br>
        MC:It would have been my art books, and even more so now I guess. Some are pretty old, hard to find, or very specific. <br> <br>
        BM: My Truck. My Truck. <br> <br>
        <strong>If you could have dinner with one person this evening, who would it be? What would you eat?</strong> <br><br>
        MC: It would be my girlfriend and she would make black noodles with lotus roots. Fingers crossed she reads this.<br> <br>
        BM:My Mother, Marianne. We would eat her Lasagna.</p>

        <p><strong>What is your biggest pre-quarantine regret?</strong> <br><br>
        MC: I think it would be the same for me and my girlfriend... putting off visiting our families until later in the year. There is a question mark to that now. <br><br>
        BM: Regrets are very regretful and therefore not useful. <br><br>
        <strong>What do you value most in people?</strong><br><br>
        MC: Positivity and good sense of humour, again, even more so now.<br> <br>
        BM:Being able to listen.<br> <br>
        <strong>What do you value most in your work?</strong><br><br>
        MC: It’s something I worried about not having, and that’s a defined style. I like to try new things, different looks, and adapt to a brief or an idea. <br> <br>
        BM: Freedom to create something three dimensional from something that was nothing at all. <br><br>
        <strong>What are you looking forward to?</strong><br><br>
        MC: Post-quarantine restaurants and travel. <br> <br>
        BM: My friends and my family. <br></p>
