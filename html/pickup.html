    <strong>Where are you quarantined? How did you end up there?</strong> <br>
    Tokyo, in my home-and-office. I'm always working here.
    <br><br><strong>Who are you quarantined with? How is it going?</strong><br>
    With my wife. <br>
    I get up early, I jog, I eat healthy food, and I sleep well. I feel healthier than before the pandemic because I'm living a very disciplined and regular life.
    <br><br>
    <strong>What is your current state of mind?</strong><br>
    In these days of uncertainty, I feel that I must be more kind and loving than ever before.<br>

        <p><strong>If you could have dinner with one person this evening, who would it be? What would you eat?</strong> <br>
        I've never thought about that. Thanks to social networking, I feel close to my friends and family. <br><br>
    
        <strong>What is your biggest pre-quarantine regret?</strong><br>
        I have no regrets. <br><br></p>
