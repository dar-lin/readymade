            <span class="1"><strong>Who are you?</strong><br>
            I’m Niki, a visual artist + wine enthusiast + employee of the year. Oh, and a Stepford wife.
            <br><br></span>

            <span class="2"><strong>Where do you live?</strong><br>
            In London, UK.<br><br></span>

            <span class="3"><strong>What is your current state of mind?</strong><br>
            Restless, as usual.<br><br></span>

            <span class="4"><strong>How do you define art?</strong><br>
            The meaning of life. Or at least mine.<br><br></span>

            <span class="5"><strong>What is your favorite quality in a person?</strong><br>
            Straightforward and independent.<br><br></span>

            <span class="6"><strong>What is your favorite quality in a piece of art?</strong><br>
            Humor, irony and bravery. I like daring pieces both in their topic and visuality.<br><br></span>

            <span class="7"><strong>Who is your favorite artist?</strong><br>
            That’s a very difficult question, I couldn’t name only one. <br><br></span>

            <span class="8"><strong>What is your favorite adjective?</strong><br>
            "whimsical"<br><br></span>

            <span class="9"><strong>What is your best quality?</strong><br>
            I can love real hard.<br><br></span>

            <span class="10"><strong>What is your worst habit?</strong><br>
            Smiling even if I don’t feel like it. It’s really hard to stop yourself if you did that all your life.<br><br></span>

            <span class="11"><strong>What is your favorite medium?</strong><br>
            I love acrylic because of its speed and opacity, it suits to my work very well. Also have a massive fetish of hand-made cotton rag paper.<br><br></span>

            <span class="12"><strong>What is your favorite meal?</strong><br>
            Anything my husband makes me.<br><br></span>

            <span class="13"><strong>What are you looking forward to?</strong><br>
            To move to a place where we can finally have pets. Two cats and a dog would be ideal.<br><br></span>
