        <p class="intro"> "I start by making a bunch of bad, quick drawings. I like drawing movements. After I do a bunch of bad drawings, a good one starts to come out, and I try to figure out how to solve it or make it better. Even though my figures, most of the time, come out really abstract or crude, they capture more of a tone or attitude than something copied from a photo. I realized that drawing has always been about design for me. My drawings are graphic exercises that help me understand what I think works and doesn’t work, aesthetically, in the world."<br> -Peter Freleng <br> <br>

            <strong>Where are you quarantined? How did you end up there?</strong><br>
            Bushwick, Brooklyn. My apartment. I was going to escape to North Carolina’s Outer Banks until they shut that down. Then I was going to stay in a camper on Long Island, where I grew up. I still might, depending on how the situation goes lol.<br><br>
            
            <strong>Who are you quarantined with? How is it going?</strong><br>
            In my building, it’s just: <br>
            My girlfriend. <br>
            My roommates--a couple.<br>
            Their dog, Nox. <br>
            My downstairs neighbors are two really good friends of mine. We share a driveway. They have a dog, Leroy. <br>
            
            It’s ok. I’m lucky to have a driveway in Brooklyn. And dogs.  Outside space is precious. I’ve become a carpenter or some shit and I’m possessed with finishing a desk I designed.<br><br>
            
            <strong>What is your current state of mind?</strong><br>
            Distracted.
            I seem to find myself making a lot of projects in order to not think about the situation. Like I said, I’m finishing a 8’ custom, wood desk for my apartment. I just got half an engine shipped to my door... considering re-building my engine just so I have something to work on. I am not a home body... <br><br>

<strong>What was your biggest worry one month ago? What is it now?</strong><br>
My entire family is in the NY/ Long Island region.<br>
I’m worried for my grandparents and my mother.<br>
Still am.<br><br>

<strong>What was your most treasured possession one month ago? What is it now?</strong><br>
My truck.<br>
I drive a 1996 Toyota Land Cruiser. And I’ve always been a slight “prepper.” It’s built out with suspension, tires, etc. for off-roading (random hobby of mine pre-Covid). I also built it as a mobile camping unit. It has a queen size bed in it, a kitchenette, and a 8’ awning.<br>

Still my truck.<br><br>

<strong>If you could have dinner with one person this evening, who would it be? What would you eat?</strong>
My friends.<br>
Honestly, it doesn’t matter--but, my friend’s wife is from Israel and she’s an amazing chef. We wanted to go over there for Shabbat and never did.<br><br><br>

        <strong>What is your biggest pre-quarantine regret?</strong><br>
Probably not transitioning out of my career sooner. I work in photo and video and the industry got hit hard. I was in the process of signing up for automotive classes, to become a tech.<br><br>

<strong>What do you value most in people?</strong><br>
Optimism. Resilience.<br>
I think people are mostly being respectful. Most people I talk to try to look on the bright side of this situation.<br>

Also, just variety. I miss learning things about people, and cultures, and food... you know, regular life stuff.<br><br>

<strong>What do you value most in your work?</strong><br>
My work is my escape. My adventure. It always has been. It’s like a problem that needs to be solved. I never know how it will look and I like when it surprises me.<br><br>

<strong>What are you looking forward to?</strong><br>
To be honest, I’m not even sure anymore. Camping? I am an avid camper/ paddler.
I had three 20+ mile Multi day kayak trips planned. They all seem canceled.<br><br><br>
